## ToDo

* [ ] Cell-centered metric

    - pro: less interpolation, better interface to SphericalNR, easier to differentiate

    - con: prolongation operation, will public supported

* [ ] Verify if the order of gridient of metrics in the source term matters (Spritz can do both 2nd and 4th order derivatives)
