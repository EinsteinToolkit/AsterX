Kokkos C++ Performance Portability Programming EcoSystem: The
Programming Model -- Parallel Execution and Memory Abstraction

Kokkos Core implements a programming model in C++ for writing
performance portable applications targeting all major HPC platforms.
For that purpose it provides abstractions for both parallel execution
of code and data management. Kokkos is designed to target complex node
architectures with N-level memory hierarchies and multiple types of
execution resources. It currently can use OpenMP, Pthreads and CUDA as
backend programming models.
