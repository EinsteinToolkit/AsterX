C++ & Python API for Scientific I/O with openPMD

openPMD is an open meta-data schema that provides meaning and
self-description for data sets in science and engineering. See the
openPMD standard for details of this schema.

This library provides a reference API for openPMD data handling. Since
openPMD is a schema (or markup) on top of portable, hierarchical file
formats, this library implements various backends such as HDF5,
ADIOS1, ADIOS2 and JSON. Writing & reading through those backends and
their associated files is supported for serial and MPI-parallel
workflows.
