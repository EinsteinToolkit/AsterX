1. Purpose

Configure the googletest library; see <https://github.com/google/googletest>



From the web site:

Googletest: Google Testing and Mocking Framework



2. Setup

Too lazy to properly setup cmake etc. Instead we just copy the
relevant source and include files into this thorn. The current source
files are taken from <googletest-release-1.10.0.tar.gz>.
