Standalone version of the Lagrange interpolation routine found in
/SetBetaEquilibrium/src/Lagrange_interp.cc . The purpose here is to test that
routine by interpolating some function (a sin function was chosen).

Compile by typing "make" in in the current directory and run with "./Main".

You can edit the "user-defined parameters" and change the sin function with
another one of your choice in Main.cc ; then, recompile and re-execute.
