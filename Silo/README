From the web site:

A Mesh and Field I/O Library and Scientific Database

Silo is a library for reading and writing a wide variety of scientific
data to binary, disk files. The files Silo produces and the data
within them can be easily shared and exchanged between wholly
independently developed applications running on disparate computing
platforms. Consequently, Silo facilitates the development of general
purpose tools for processing scientific data. One of the more popular
tools that process Silo data files is the VisIt visualization tool.
