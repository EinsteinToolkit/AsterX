ADIOS2 : The Adaptable Input Output System version 2

This is ADIOS2: The Adaptable Input/Output (I/O) System.

ADIOS2 is developed as part of the United States Department of
Energy's Exascale Computing Project. It is a framework for scientific
data I/O to publish and subscribe to data when and where required.

ADIOS2 transports data as groups of self-describing variables and
attributes across different media types (such as files,
wide-area-networks, and remote direct memory access) using a common
application programming interface for all transport modes. ADIOS2 can
be used on supercomputers, cloud systems, and personal computers.
